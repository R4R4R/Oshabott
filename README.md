# Oshabott
A discord music bot that I spent 3 years (2018-2020) writing in the Rewrite version of Discord.py and the YouTube-dl api.
  - Fnakbot, my old bot, was written in the Async (old) version of the Discord.py api

Disclaimer: I coded most of this bot in high school and before I was ever officially taught Python (I hadn't even taken a comp sci class when I made Fnakbot) so 
there are likely some noticeably bad coding habits that I haven't fixed. 
A lot of files from my PC are excluded and the Token is taken out for security and privacy.

I used https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/blob/master/examples/basic_voice.py and https://gist.github.com/EvieePy/d78c061a4798ae81be9825468fe146be
to set up the base of my Rewrite bot and added a lot of new functions on top of the old ones from Fnakbot.

Functions include queueing songs, playing songs, searching up songs, skipping songs by majority vote through reactions, showing which songs are playing 
and what is on the queue, and an autoplaylist.
  - The most unique function of this bot that I hadn't another discord bot have is letting users create their own personal playlists (saved to files on my pc).
    Users can set the autoplaylist to their playlist if everyone in the voice chat agrees.

This repository only contains the Music Cog of the bot, I will likely add my currently unfinished Games and Misc Cogs to this repo sometime soon.
