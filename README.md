# Oshabott
A discord music bot that I spent 3 years writing in the Async version of Discord.py and the YouTube-dl api.
After taking a break from coding it and getting a new computer, I decided to remake the bot in the Rewrite version of Discord.py.
I used https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/blob/master/examples/basic_voice.py and https://gist.github.com/EvieePy/d78c061a4798ae81be9825468fe146be
to set up the base of my Rewrite bot and added a lot of new functions on top of the old ones.
Functions include queueing songs, playing songs, searching up songs, skipping songs by majority vote through reactions, showing which songs are playing 
and what is on the queue, and an autoplaylist.
The most unique function of this bot that I have never seen another discord bot have is letting users create their own personal playlists (saved to files on my pc).
Users can set the autoplaylist to their playlist if everyone in the voice chat agrees.
This repository only contains the Music Cog of the bot, I will likely add my currently unfinished Games and Misc Cogs to this repo sometime soon.
Disclaimer: I coded most of this bot before I was ever officially taught Python (and for the Async version, programming in general) so 
there are likely some noticeably bad coding habits.
